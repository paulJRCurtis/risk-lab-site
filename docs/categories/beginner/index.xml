This lab is a great place to start if you are new to AWS and mixes a bit of hand on with supporting theory.
AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. It provides on-demand access to AWSâ€™ security and compliance reports and select online agreements.</description></item><item><title>Detective Controls with Config</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/4-detective-controls-config/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/4-detective-controls-config/</guid><description>In this lab we will use three AWS Config rules to demonstrate how to check the configuration of an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.</description></item></channel></rss>
