To set a patch baseline open the AWS Systems Manager console. In the navigation pane, choose Inventory.
If you can only see the AWS Systems Manager home page, you may need to click on the menu icon (â˜°) in the top left to open the navigation pane, and then choose Inventory.</description></item><item><title>Start the Workshop</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/1-start-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:41:43 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/1-start-workshop/</guid><description>To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are;
running the workshop on your own (in your own account),
or
attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)</description></item><item><title>Set patch baselines</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/2-set-patch-baselines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/2-set-patch-baselines/</guid><description>As well as providing insight into the environment systems manager allows you to actively manage instances including applying patches. Patch Manager has predefined patch baselines for each operating system it supports. You can use these patch baselines to patch your instances, or you can create your own. In this Jam we will use the predefined patch baselines.
The environment provided for this challenge includes two fleets of EC2 Instances, one fleet includes three Amazon Linux 2 instances, the other two instances running a version of Windows.</description></item><item><title>Review compliance</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/3-review-compliance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/3-review-compliance/</guid><description>Now that you have set the patching baseline for your two patch groups (jam-windows-app-patch-group and jam-linux-app-patch-group) you have something to compare against. You now need to determine the effectiveness of the current manual patching controls. To do this you will identify the number of non-compliant resources.
Use AWS Systems Manager - Compliance to determine the total number of non-compliant resource.
Go to the Compliance screen in Systems Manager, you will see a screen similar to the below.</description></item><item><title>Create a Maintenance Window</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/4-maintenance-window/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/4-maintenance-window/</guid><description>AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches. These may require Systems Manager to perform a restart so these actions should be scheduled appropriately.
Create a maintenance window which you will use to patch the Windows and Amazon Linux 2 instances. The details of the maintenance window details such as time, duration, frequency are all up to you.</description></item><item><title>Getting to Know the Console</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/2-know-the-console/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:34:54 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/2-know-the-console/</guid><description>Login to your AWS Account If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, logon to your AWS account. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an account, go to Start Workshop.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get to know the Management Console
The AWS Management Console is a web application that comprises and refers to a broad collection of service consoles for managing Amazon Web Services. When you first sign in, you see the console home page.
Along the top menubar you will see a few important elements we will use often.</description></item><item><title>Detective Controls with Config</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/4-detective-controls-config/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/4-detective-controls-config/</guid><description>In this lab we will use three AWS Config and AWS Config Rules to demonstrate how to automate checks of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket configuration.
AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Create Patch Manager configuration</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/5-patch-manager-config/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/5-patch-manager-config/</guid><description>Now that you have setup the patch baselines and the maintenance window there is one final task to configure Patch Manager to automatically apply patches as per your schedule.
Configure Patch Manager to apply patched to both of your patch groups during the maintenance window you set up in the previous task.
From the Patch Manager console choose Configure patching.
Complete the Patch manager configuration by selecting the two patch groups, the maintenance schedule you created earlier, and selecting Scan and install, then click Configure patching.</description></item><item><title>Patching Controls with Systems Manager</title><link>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:17:40 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://paulJRCurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/patching-controls-with-ssm/</guid><description>Many organizations struggle to keep up with patching requirements. Sometimes one of the challenges is even to know what infrastructure you have. A definitive inventory of the operating systems and software running in the environment is not always easy to come by.
In a cloud environment there are two different approaches based on whether the architecture includes instances that are immutable or non-immutable.
This might seem a confusing statement, but lets break it down.</description></item></channel></rss>
