# Risk & Compliance Labs
## Introduction ##  
These labs have been developed specifically with risk, compliance and controls assurance stakeholders in mind. AWS provides a wealth of services and tools to assist in effective management and governance and provides an unprecedented level of transparency.  These labs aim to demonstrate how these services and the telemetry available on the platform can be used to automate controls assurance and provide a real time risk data. These labs  have been designed to cater for the absolute beginner, building up to more advanced topics.

This repository contains documentation and code in the format of hands-on labs to help you learn, measure, and build. Some labs, particularly the introductory labs maybe be simplified to demonstrate concepts rather than attempting to be production ready approaches.  Where this is the case it will be noted in the lab.  

The labs are categorized into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

## Prerequisites ##  
An AWS account that you are able to use for learning and experimenting, that is not used for production or other purposes. If you are doing these labs at an AWS event you may be given an account.

### Beginner Labs ###
For Beginner labs there are no prerequisites and no assumed AWS knowledge, however the labs to build on each other and should ideally be taken in sequence.

### Intermediate Labs ###
For Intermediate and Advanced Labs you may require the following.
- A working directory where you have the rights to create files and directories.
- A text editor, we will be editing a few configuration files and scripts but not doing any major coding so a basic editor will do - notepad or TextEdit are fine.
- We will be using zip files so you will need to be able to un-zip and zip files.
